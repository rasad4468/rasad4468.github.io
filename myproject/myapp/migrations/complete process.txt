INSTALLED_APPS` includes `'myapp'`. Here is the complete process to ensure everything is correctly set up and migrations are applied:

### Complete Steps to Apply Migrations and Set Up the Project

#### 1. Stop the Development Server
If the server is running, stop it by pressing `CTRL-C` in the Command Prompt (or terminal).

#### 2. Ensure `INSTALLED_APPS` is Correct
Open `myproject/settings.py` and make sure your `INSTALLED_APPS` looks like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'myapp',
]
```

#### 3. Apply Migrations
Run the following command in the directory where your `manage.py` file is located:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### 4. Start the Development Server Again
After applying the migrations, start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Example Commands

1. **Stop the Server** (if it's running):
   ```bash
   CTRL-C
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Ensure `INSTALLED_APPS` is Correct**:
   Ensure `INSTALLED_APPS` in `myproject/settings.py` includes the necessary apps as shown above.

4. **Start the Server Again**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Verifying the Setup

- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to verify that the server is running without issues.
